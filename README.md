# Laplacian
Development of optimized Laplacian compute kernel

## Checklist 
Things to be done in week 4: 
* generate agnostic function signature;                             ✓ 
* ensure CubismNova blocks and fields can be easily passed;         ✓
* provide Laplacian discretization to several orders of accuracy;   ✓
* generate a mostly generalized order verification study. 

Things to be done in week 5:
* implement order verification study as test; 
* Roofline Model background literature; 
* ISPC re-fresh through HPCSE I homework exercise. 

Things to be done in week 6:
