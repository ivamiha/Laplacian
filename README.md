Development of optimized Laplacian compute kernel

## Project checklist 
The date within brackets `[dd/mm/yy]` denotes the due date originally assigned 
during the planning of the project. A color code has been utilized to denote 
the "relevance" of the task <br /> 
游릭 task necessary for project completion, <br />
游리 task optional, but would ideally like to implement.
