# Laplacian
Development of optimized Laplacian compute kernel

## Checklist 
Things to be done in week 4: 
* generate agnostic function signature; 
* ensure CubismNova blocks and fields can be easily passed; 
* provide Laplacian discretization to several orders of accuracy; 
* generate a mostly generalized order verification study.
