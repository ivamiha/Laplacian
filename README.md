# Laplacian
Semester thesis focusing on the development of optimized Laplacian compute 
kernels with application to the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion system. The 
project works with the `CubismNova` framework; a C++ template library used for
solving partial differential equations on structured uniform or stretched 
grids. The developed compute kernels are optimized with the addition of 
data-level parallelism (DLP) with `ISPC` and thread-level parallelism (TLP)
with `OMP`. 

## Project checklist 
The date within brackets `[dd/mm/yy]` denotes the due date originally assigned 
during the planning of the project. A color code has been utilized to denote 
the "relevance" of the task <br /> 
游릭 task necessary for project completion, <br />
游리 task optional, but would ideally like to implement.
